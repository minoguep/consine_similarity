# Cosine similarity

The code/data within this repository support the examples discussed in [my blog post](http://paulminogue.com/index.php/2019/09/29/introduction-to-cosine-similarity/) on cosine similarity and sentence vectorisation.

Feel free to download, run, and play around with this code to gain a better understanding of sentence similarity!
